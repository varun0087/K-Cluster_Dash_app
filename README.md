# K-Cluster_Dash_app
K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm used in machine learning and data science. It is used for partitioning a given dataset into K clusters (groups) based on the similarity between data points. The goal of K-means is to minimize the sum of distances between each data point and its assigned cluster center, known as the "centroid".
